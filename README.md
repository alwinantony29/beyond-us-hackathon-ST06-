# Excel extractor ( 1 Day Online Hackathon )

## Problem Description:
Managing data from Excel files can be cumbersome and time-consuming, especially when it involves populating form fields with data from specific lines. To simplify this process and enhance data management efficiency, we need to develop a system that allows users to upload Excel files and automatically populate a form with the selected data. The system should also provide the capability to update and save the data, as well as download it in Excel format

## Problem Statement:
Create a functional mobile application or web app that enables users to upload Excel files in a specific format. The system should display the details from the Excel file and allow users to click on a specific line to populate a form with the corresponding data. Users should be able to edit and save the populated data, with the provision to download the updated data in Excel format.
